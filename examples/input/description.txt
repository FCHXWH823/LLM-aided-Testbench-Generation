A simple 4-bit adder module.

The module takes two 4-bit input signals (a and b) and produces a 4-bit sum output and a 1-bit carry output.

Functionality:
- Input 'a': 4-bit unsigned number
- Input 'b': 4-bit unsigned number  
- Output 'sum': 4-bit result of a + b (lower 4 bits)
- Output 'carry': 1-bit carry-out flag (set to 1 if result exceeds 15)

The adder performs unsigned addition of the two 4-bit inputs.
If the result is greater than 15 (0xF), the carry output should be set to 1.
